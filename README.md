# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

In this sprint, you'll continue working on the “WTWR” web application. Your goal for this iteration is to continue implementing functionality using the React features you've just learned. You will implement the following:

A temperature unit toggle switch using React context
A profile page route using React Router
Form submission using controlled components or refs
You'll also set up a mock server and write some code to make API calls to it. This mock server will mimic the behavior of the backend that you'll start building in Sprint 12.
